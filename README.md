I was given the task of analyzing stock market data
I built a table showing each ticker symbols yearly change, percentage change, and total volume per year. Then I ran code to see which stock had the greatest increase change, decrease change, and total volume
I did this in order to see how well a stock was performing over the year and how much of a change it had.
From the data stocks ticker: RKS had over 90% decrease in 2018 and 2019. I would be cautious investing this stock (RKS), and maybe explore other variables that may have affected the decrease before investing in that stock.  Also Ticker QKN had the greatest total volume 2018 and 2020, so it may be a popular stock.
